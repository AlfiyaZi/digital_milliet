			<h2>What is the Digital Milliet?</h2>
			<p>
				The few works of scholarship dealing with ancient painting are outdated and not easily accessible. The first systematic study was given by J. Overbeck at the end of the 19th century in a sourcebook titled Die antiken Schriftquellen zur Geschichte der bildenden Künste bei den Griechen (1868). This sourcebook, although it was made available in a recent re-edition (April 2014), remains obscure. Moreover, the 1868 edition offers no translations for the Greek and Latin texts, adding yet a further difficulty to the already impractical encyclopedic format of the books, and further restricting the audience. This challenge was noted by P. Milliet at the beginning of the 20th century. Milliet was an academic painter fascinated by classical art. Yet, as an educated amateur he was concerned by the lack of translations and commentaries on ancient Greek and Latin texts about painting. Therefore, he sponsored a major project, the Recueil Milliet. Textes grecs et latins relatifs à la peinture ancienne. This project was launched in 1906 and directed by the classical archaeologist Gustave Mendel. After a long time of inactivity, the project was reattributed to Adolphe Reinach. Unfortunately, this talented young classicist and archaeologist died tragically on the battlefield in WWI (1914) and the project was never completed. However, in 1921, his uncle, the famous classical archaeologist Salomon Reinach, published the first book of the Recueil Milliet. The purpose of this compilation, translation, and commentary was to offer an intelligible corpus of Greek and Latin texts about painting to an educated audience. These objectives reflect the French republican ideals of the early 20th century, which valued the common good, multidisciplinarity, and stood against hyper-specialization. In this sense, the Recueil Milliet was an innovation. It offered a bridge between the great German philological tradition of the 19th century and the archeological discoveries of the early 20th century. The book was reedited in 1985 by Agnès Rouveret, with a new introduction and an updated bibliography.

				Our project renews the Recueil Milliet and takes it further. We offer digital resources thatfollow the current best practices in information technology as well as in Classics. First of all, we propose to reorganize the textual sources. In the original Recueil Milliet, Reinach chose to reproduce Pliny’s evolutionary view of the arts, according to which artistic endeavors began in the darkness of the Archaic Age (7th century BCE) and culminated in the light of the classical period, embodied by Apelles and the Alexandrine school of painting (4th century BCE). Such a vision of history and indeed, of art history, was accurate from Antiquity until the 20th century, but it is outdated today. Therefore, we propose to organize the texts thematically in order to facilitate cross-referenced searches. In practical terms, this means that the texts that were present in the Recueil Milliet will be exported from the Perseus Digital Library to the Perseids platform in a thematic folder. Further texts, which were not present in Reinach’s initial work, will be added such as extracts from Plato’s Cratylus, fragments from satiric drama, tragedy, lyric poetry, and pre-Socratic philosophers like Empedocles. French and English translations will accompany each text. The choice to incorporate French translations is part of the collaborators’ effort to open the Perseus and Perseids projects to languages other than English in order to reach as broad an audience as possible. The French translations originally published by Reinach will be revised (they are in the public domain) where necessary. References to the initial numbering of the Recueil Milliet will be incorporated as a way to honor Reinach’s work, without which this project could not exist. Finally, commentaries will be added to the texts in the form of linked keywords which will bring the user to a commentary window with up-to-date bibliographical notes.

			<h2>Who is the Digital Milliet?</h2>
			
			<h4><b>Marie-Claire Beaulieu</b>, Project Director</h4>
			<p>
				Marie-Claire Beaulieu's interests are concentrated in two main areas: Greek religion and Digital Humanities. In Greek religion, she has published articles and given professional talks on various aspects of Greek cults and myths, especially centering on myths of the sea. She has a particular interest in the role of animals in Greek mythology, and has investigated dolphins and ducks in detail, among others. She is currently finishing a book, titled "Bridging Horizons. The Sea in Greek Mythology and Cosmology", in which she proposes that the sea marks the boundary between mortals, immortals, and the dead. For this reason, mythical sea-crossings are transforming journeys, as mortals challenge the boundaries imposed on them and transition to the afterlife or join the company of the gods. This book arrives at a timely moment in the Humanities, when the history of geography and cosmology is being reevaluated and reinterpreted. In the age of Google Earth, when any location on earth can be examined remotely with an unprecedented degree of precision, questions about the relationship between humans and the shape of their world become more pressing than ever.

				In Digital Humanities, Marie-Claire Beaulieu is working on making the creation and dissemination of knowledge about the ancient world more accessible. She is the co-director of the Perseids Project, a collaborative online environment in which users can edit, translate, and produce commentaries on a variety of ancient source documents, including inscriptions, medieval manuscripts, and texts transmitted through the manuscript tradition such as Homer's Iliad. In her classes, students have the opportunity to publish ancient documents on the Web as term projects, thereby integrating their learning experience with an original contribution to research. Some of the current projects undertaken by students include the edition, translation, and publication of the Tisch Miscellany Collection, Greek funerary inscriptions, commentaries on source materials for Greek mythology, and an edition and translation of a 14th century compendium of English forest law held in Tisch Library at Tufts.
